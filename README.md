ReactPHP HttpClient Adapter for Guzzle4, for Guzzle5 check [ReactGuzzleRing](https://github.com/WyriHaximus/ReactGuzzleRing)

## Current state ##

This adapter is in active development and is subject to change at any given time. Untill 0.1.0 is tagged, use with caution!


## Installation ##

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `~`.

```
composer require wyrihaximus/react-guzzle 
```

## Basic Usage ##

```php
<?php

require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\Message\Response;
use React\EventLoop\Factory;
use WyriHaximus\React\Guzzle\HttpClientAdapter;
use WyriHaximus\React\Guzzle\HttpClient\ProgressInterface;

// Create eventloop
$loop = Factory::create();

$client = new Client([
    'adapter' => new HttpClientAdapter($loop),
]);
$client->get('http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/')->then(function(Response $response) { // Success callback
    var_export($response);
}, function($event) { // Error callback
    var_export($event);
}, function(ProgressInterface $event) { // Progress callback
    var_export($event);
});

$loop->run();

```

See the [examples](https://github.com/WyriHaximus/ReactGuzzle/tree/master/examples) directory for more ways to use this adapter.

## Note about save_to ##

File I/O in react is blocking and doesn't always play well with certain event loops. So use `save_to` with caution as it will have a less then optimal performance.
